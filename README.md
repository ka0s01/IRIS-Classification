# Iris Classification Project ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ¸

This project showcases the application of machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flower species based on their features. Using the classic Iris dataset, the project trains and evaluates multiple models to predict flower species.

## Dataset ðŸ“ŠðŸ“Š

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of three different Iris species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Each sample includes four features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

## Models Used ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

## Features âœ¨âœ¨

- Stratified train-test split to preserve class distribution
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training and prediction
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
- Visual comparisons through bar charts and heatmaps

## Results ðŸ“ˆðŸ“ˆ

- Achieved over 93% accuracy across models.
- KNN showed slightly better accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and SVC.
- Detailed metrics and confusion matrices have been added to  help understand model strengths and weaknesses.

## Personal Goals ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯

This project is an important milestone in my machine learning journey. Through building and evaluating models for the Iris classification task, I aimed to:

- Gain hands-on experience working with classic datasets widely used for learning ML fundamentals.  
- Understand the strengths and limitations of different classification algorithms by comparing KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVC.  
- Practice best practices in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization to improve my analytical skills.  
- Develop a clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebook to showcase my progress and share knowledge with the community.  
- Build confidence in using Python ML libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for end-to-end machine learning workflows.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced experiments and real-world machine learning applications I plan to explore next.

## Future Improvements ðŸ”§ðŸ”§

- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search with cross-validation.
- Integrate model interpretability tools such as SHAP or LIME.
- Develop automated pipelines for preprocessing and evaluation.
- Deploy models as REST APIs for real-world applications.
